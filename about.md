Hi, Iâ€™m **Anurag Bhatt** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer from India. These days, I spend my time building games, exploring graphics programming, and tinkering with whatever idea won't leave my head.

This blog is my digital playground, a mix of:
- Projects Iâ€™m building (and sometimes breaking)
- Thoughts on game dev, code, and design
- Stories, odd observations, and the occasional rant

If you enjoy following someone figuring things out in public, youâ€™ll feel right at home here.
