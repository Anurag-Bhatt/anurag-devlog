Hey, Iâ€™m Anurag Bhatt ðŸ‘‹  
I just completed my B.Tech in Production Engineering from NIT Calicut and Iâ€™m diving into the world of software development.

This is Day 1 of my journey to **code and document my progress until I land a job**. Iâ€™ll be building games, graphics demos, procedural tools, and whatever else keeps me learning and excited.

Todayâ€™s focus:
- Set up this blog using GitHub Pages + Jekyll
- Made a public commitment to document every day

Letâ€™s go ðŸš€
